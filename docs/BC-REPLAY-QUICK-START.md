A practical guide to executing Business Central page scripts in automated pipelines using the bc-replay test runner.

![Playwright HTML test report](images/04-playwright-report.png)

## What is BC-Replay?

BC-replay is an npm package that executes Business Central page scripting YAML files outside the BC web client. It's designed for **automated testing in CI/CD pipelines**, allowing you to run recorded user acceptance tests without manual interaction.

**Key concept:** BC-replay replays scripts created with BC's page scripting tool. Record once in BC, replay automatically in your pipeline.

## Prerequisites

**Required Software:**
- **Node.js** 16.14.0 or later ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- **PowerShell** 7+ ([install guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows))

**Required Scripts:**
- YAML recording files from BC page scripting tool

**Authentication:**
- Standard: Username/password accounts (no MFA)
- **🔐 MFA TOTP: Natively supported!** Use `-MultiFactorType TOTP` - no patches or workarounds needed

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Create Folder Structure
```powershell
# Create project folders
mkdir c:\bc-replay
mkdir c:\bc-replay\recordings
mkdir c:\bc-replay\results

cd c:\bc-replay
```

### 2. Install BC-Replay
```powershell
# Install package and Playwright dependencies
npm i @microsoft/bc-replay --save
```

**What this does:** Downloads bc-replay npm package and Playwright browser automation framework (~17MB).

### 3. Add Your Scripts
Copy your recorded YAML files to `c:\bc-replay\recordings\`:
```powershell
# Example: Copy from project folder
copy "c:\Git\MyProject\*.yml" "c:\bc-replay\recordings\"
```

## Running Scripts

### Basic Execution

**Single script:**
```powershell
cd c:\bc-replay
npx replay .\recordings\my-test.yml -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment
```

**All scripts in folder:**
```powershell
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment
```

**With result output:**
```powershell
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment `
  -ResultDir c:\bc-replay\results
```

### Authentication Options

**Windows Authentication (default):**
```powershell
# No additional parameters needed - uses current Windows credentials
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml -StartAddress http://localhost:8080/bc
```

**Microsoft Entra ID / User Password:**
```powershell
# Set credentials as environment variables
$env:BC_USERNAME = "testuser@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"
$env:BC_PASSWORD = "YourPassword123"

# Run with authentication parameters
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment `
  -Authentication UserPassword `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -ResultDir c:\bc-replay\results
```

💡 **Note:** This is for standard (non-MFA) accounts. For MFA-enabled accounts, see the **[MFA Support section](#-mfa-support-native-totp)** below.

### Advanced Options

**Watch tests run (headed mode):**
```powershell
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment `
  -Headed
```

**Complete example with all options:**
```powershell
$env:BC_USERNAME = "testuser@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"
$env:BC_PASSWORD = "YourPassword123"

npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment `
  -Authentication UserPassword `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -Headed `
  -ResultDir c:\bc-replay\results
```

## 🔐 MFA Support (Native TOTP)

bc-replay natively supports TOTP-based MFA (authenticator app) via built-in parameters - no patching or custom scripts required.

### How It Works

1. Your test account has MFA enabled (authenticator app / TOTP method)
2. You capture the TOTP seed **once** during account setup
3. Store the seed in an environment variable
4. Pass `-MultiFactorType TOTP -MultiFactorSecretKey <env-var-name>` to bc-replay
5. bc-replay automatically generates the time-based OTP during login

### Setup

**Step 1: Create a test account with TOTP MFA**
1. Create a test account in Microsoft Entra ID
2. Enable the Authenticator app (TOTP) method for MFA
3. **CRITICAL:** During setup, the QR code screen shows a "Can't scan?" or "Setup key" link - this is your TOTP seed
4. Copy and save that seed securely - **it is only shown once**

> ⚠️ The seed is never shown again after setup. If you miss it, delete and recreate the MFA method.

#### Getting Your TOTP Seed — Visual Guide

Use an **InPrivate / Incognito** browser window throughout these steps to avoid cached sessions interfering.

**1. Confirm Software OATH tokens are enabled in Entra ID**

Before setting up the account, ensure your tenant allows Software OATH tokens as an authentication method (`Entra ID → Security → Authentication methods`).

![Entra ID Authentication Methods settings showing Software OATH tokens enabled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywingate/D365BC-vibe-page-scripting/main/bc-replay/bc-replay-mfa-solution/.assets/image.png)

**2. Go to https://account.microsoft.com/security and sign in**

Sign in with your test account credentials. Navigate to **Security info** and click **Add sign-in method**.

**3. Choose "I want to use a different authenticator app"**

When prompted, select "I want to set up a different method" or bypass the default suggestion and choose **Authenticator app**.

![Microsoft security info page with setup different method option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywingate/D365BC-vibe-page-scripting/main/bc-replay/bc-replay-mfa-solution/.assets/image-1.png)

**4. Click Next on the Authenticator app setup page**

![Microsoft Authenticator app setup start page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywingate/D365BC-vibe-page-scripting/main/bc-replay/bc-replay-mfa-solution/.assets/image-2.png)

**5. On the QR code screen, click "Can't scan image?"**

Do **not** scan the QR code. Instead click the **"Can't scan image?"** link to reveal the text secret key.

![QR code screen with "Can't scan image?" link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywingate/D365BC-vibe-page-scripting/main/bc-replay/bc-replay-mfa-solution/.assets/image-3.png)

![Alternative view of QR code setup screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywingate/D365BC-vibe-page-scripting/main/bc-replay/bc-replay-mfa-solution/.assets/image-4.png)

**6. Copy the secret key — this is your TOTP seed**

The secret key displayed here (Base32 format) is your `BC_MFA_SEED` value. Copy it now and store it in a password manager or secure notes.

**7. Complete the setup and verify**

Add the seed to an authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, etc.) to confirm it generates valid codes, then finish the wizard.

**Step 2: Store the seed in an environment variable**
```powershell
$env:BC_MFA_SEED = "YOUR_TOTP_SEED_HERE"
```

**Step 3: Run bc-replay with TOTP support**
```powershell
$env:BC_USERNAME = "testuser@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"
$env:BC_PASSWORD  = "YourPassword123"
$env:BC_MFA_SEED  = "YOUR_TOTP_SEED_HERE"

npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment `
  -Authentication AAD `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -MultiFactorType TOTP `
  -MultiFactorSecretKey BC_MFA_SEED `
  -ResultDir c:\bc-replay\results
```

### CI/CD Pipeline with MFA

Store `BC_MFA_SEED` as a pipeline secret (GitHub Secrets, Azure Key Vault, etc.) alongside your username and password:

```powershell
# GitHub Actions example (secrets set in repo settings)
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress $env:BC_URL `
  -Authentication AAD `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -MultiFactorType TOTP `
  -MultiFactorSecretKey BC_MFA_SEED `
  -ResultDir ./test-results
```

## Common Scenarios

### Local On-Premises BC
```powershell
# Windows authentication to local BC instance
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress http://localhost:8080/bc250 `
  -ResultDir c:\bc-replay\results
```

### BC SaaS Sandbox
```powershell
# UserPassword authentication to cloud sandbox
$env:BC_USERNAME = "admin@cronus.onmicrosoft.com"
$env:BC_PASSWORD = "P@ssw0rd"

npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/Sandbox `
  -Authentication UserPassword `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -ResultDir c:\bc-replay\results
```

### Debug Failing Script
```powershell
# Run single script in headed mode to watch execution
npx replay .\recordings\failing-test.yml `
  -StartAddress https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/environment `
  -Authentication UserPassword `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -Headed
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```powershell
# Typical pipeline execution - headless with results
npx replay .\recordings\*.yml `
  -StartAddress $env:BC_URL `
  -Authentication UserPassword `
  -UserNameKey BC_USERNAME `
  -PasswordKey BC_PASSWORD `
  -ResultDir ./test-results

# Check exit code for pipeline success/failure
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { 
    Write-Error "Tests failed"
    exit $LASTEXITCODE 
}
```

## Environment Variables Best Practices

**Local Development:**
```powershell
# Set for current session
$env:BC_USERNAME = "testuser@tenant.com"
$env:BC_PASSWORD = "Password123"

# Or create a local script (DON'T commit to Git!)
# setup-local-env.ps1
$env:BC_USERNAME = "testuser@tenant.com"
$env:BC_PASSWORD = "Password123"
$env:BC_URL = "https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/tenant/sandbox"
```

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Store credentials in pipeline secrets (GitHub Secrets, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Never hardcode credentials in scripts
- Use pipeline variables: `$env:BC_USERNAME`, `$env:BC_PASSWORD`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Module not found" | bc-replay not installed | Run `npm i @microsoft/bc-replay --save` |
| "Authentication failed" | Wrong credentials or MFA blocking | Verify credentials; for MFA accounts add `-MultiFactorType TOTP -MultiFactorSecretKey BC_MFA_SEED` |
| "Page not found" | Wrong BC URL | Verify `-StartAddress` URL is accessible |
| Scripts pass locally but fail in pipeline | Different data in environments | Ensure test data exists in both environments |
| "Chromium not found" | Playwright browsers not installed | Run `npx playwright install chromium` |
| MFA prompt appears | Account has MFA enabled | Add `-MultiFactorType TOTP -MultiFactorSecretKey BC_MFA_SEED` - see [MFA section](#-mfa-support-native-totp) |

## Integration with This Repository

This repository provides **script generation** in `page-scripting/` folder and **test execution** in `bc-replay/` folder:

1. **Generate variants:** Use PowerShell scripts in `page-scripting/` to create test combinations
2. **Execute tests:** Use bc-replay in `bc-replay/` to run generated variants
3. **Review results:** Analyze Playwright reports to validate business processes

**Workflow:**
```
Record BASE script → Generate variants → Execute with bc-replay → Review reports
```

## Multi-User Workflow Orchestration

For business processes that span multiple users (e.g., create PO → approve PO → receive goods), use the workflow orchestrator instead of running individual scripts.

### How It Works

1. Define a `workflow.json` with steps, user roles, scripts, and capture/inject rules
2. Define a `users.json` with credentials for each user role
3. The orchestrator runs each step sequentially with the correct user's credentials
4. Captured values (e.g., PO number) are injected into subsequent steps via BC's native `parameters:` section

### Running a Workflow

```powershell
# Credentials are stored in users.json per role
# Execute the workflow
.\Run-BCWorkflow.ps1 -WorkflowPath "..\page-scripting\PO Approval Workflow"

# Options
.\Run-BCWorkflow.ps1 -WorkflowPath "..." -Headed          # Watch execution
.\Run-BCWorkflow.ps1 -WorkflowPath "..." -DryRun           # Preview without running
.\Run-BCWorkflow.ps1 -WorkflowPath "..." -StopOnFailure:$false  # Continue on errors
```

### Results

```
results/
  workflow-summary.html    # Overall workflow report (open in browser)
  workflow-summary.json    # Machine-readable results
  step-create-po/          # Per-step Playwright report
  step-approve-po/         # Per-step Playwright report
```

See [PO Approval Workflow](../page-scripting/PO%20Approval%20Workflow/) for a complete example and [MULTI-USER-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md](MULTI-USER-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md) for architecture details.

## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Store credentials in environment variables, never in scripts
- Use `-ResultDir` to preserve test history
- Run scripts in consistent order for reproducible results
- Use glob patterns (`*.yml`) to run suites
- Add bc-replay folder to CI/CD pipeline
- **Use `-MultiFactorType TOTP` for MFA-enabled accounts** - natively supported, no patching needed

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit credentials to version control
- Forget to capture the TOTP seed during account setup - it's shown only once
- Run headed mode in CI/CD pipelines (causes hanging)
- Assume data exists without validation
- Mix Windows auth and UserPassword auth in same pipeline

## Next Steps

1. **Record your first script** - See [PAGE-SCRIPTING-QUICK-START.md](PAGE-SCRIPTING-QUICK-START.md)
2. **Generate variants** - Use PowerShell scripts in `../page-scripting/`
3. **Multi-user workflows** - See `Run-BCWorkflow.ps1` and the [PO Approval Workflow](../page-scripting/PO%20Approval%20Workflow/) example
4. **Set up CI/CD** - Integrate bc-replay into your build pipeline
5. **Monitor results** - Review Playwright reports after each run
